SQL START

This is a file on how to get started on mySQL on Linux.

1. installing mySQL:
	in terminal, run: sudo apt install mysql-server -y
	
2. to verify the server is running:
	in terminal, run: sudo systemctl status mysql
	
if mySQL is not running, start the service with:
	in terminal,run: sudo systemctl start mysql
	
the service mySQL can later be stopped running with:
	in terminal, run: sudo systemctl stop mysql
	
(this is as much about how to use systemctl as it is to run the server.
	look into how systemctl works, and how it runs linux services.)
	
*note that this version has a blank password but may only be run from this physical unit.

3. use the terminal command sudo mysql -u root -p to pull up the mysql monitor.

4. once inside the prompt, you can create a database and list existing databases.
	to create a database: at the sql prompt, type: CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
	
* note that it is common for sql commands to be rendered in all caps and many - but not all - end in a semicolon.

	to list all available databases, at the sql prompt, type: SHOW DATABASES;
	
	leaving the sql prompt:
		at the sql prompt, type EXIT; or QUIT;
		
*The capitalization is not strictly needed for SQL commands, but helps humans identify them more clearly.

This includes the basic commands to start, stop, and view status on the service, to list databases and create databases.

to delete a complete database from the system:
	in terminal at the sql prompt, use DROP DATABASE <database name>;
	
*Note that while commands are not case sensitive, the names of databases are.

So, noting the Quad of server functions, let's review briefly the acronym of CRUD.

1. Create
2. Read
3. Update
4. Delete

The Create and Delete functions occur on this level of using mySQL. 

Reading and updating require more specific commands, which are yet to come.

This is the end of the first part.
