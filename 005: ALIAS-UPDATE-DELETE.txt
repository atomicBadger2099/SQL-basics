ALIAS, UPDATE, AND DELETE:


1. alias: a one-time change of the name of a column.
	using an alias:
		SELECT <column_name> AS <column_alias> FROM <table_name>;
		
		example: SELECT cat_id AS number FROM cats;
		
* sometimes using an alias can shorten a name or add clarity.


2. using UPDATE:

	UPDATE 	may be used to alter existing data.
	
	UPDATE and SET are at the very least used in pairs, and is often be used with WHERE.
	
	format: 
		UPDATE <table_name> SET <column_name or condition> WHERE <further filter_condition>;
		
		example: UPDATE cats SET type = 'domesticated';  * defines entire column as 'domesticated'
		
		example: UPDATE cats SET breed = 'shorthair' WHERE name = 'Misty'; 
	
		example: UPDATE cats SET age = 14 WHERE name = 'Boggles';
		
		
	remember triad of UPDATE - SET - WHERE;
	
	
3. using DELETE:

	format: DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE <condition>;
	
	example: DELETE FROM cats;  * will delete ALL data in the cats table in one swipe
	
	example: DELETE FROM cats WHERE name = 'Egg'; * deletes entry for 'Egg';
