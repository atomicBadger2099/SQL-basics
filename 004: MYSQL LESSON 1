MYSQL LESSON 1:


1. showing a list of current databases:
	use the command SHOW DATABASES; 
	
2. creating a new, empty database:
	use the command CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
	SHOW DATABASES can then be used to confirm it was successfully created.
	
3. to select a database for usage:
	use the command USE <database_name> (no semicolon required for USE)
	
4. to create a table:
	USE <database_name>
	CREATE TABLE <table_name>;
	
5. to list the tables within a database:
	USE <database_name>
	SHOW TABLES;
	
6. to show what databases are actively being used:
	SELECT database();
	
* note that tables are containers of data that live within a database.

* note that to create a table you must have a basic understanding of the datatypes you are going to use.

2 datatypes for beginning with tables: (there are other, more advanced datatypes)

	VARCHAR(X) - used for entering basic words or names.
	EXAMPLES: VARCHAR(50), VARCHAR(100)
	
	INT - used for basic integer numbers - 1, 5, 11, 90, ect.
	
7. table creation by example:

	USE pets_database
	CREATE TABLE cats_table
		(name VARCHAR(100),
		 age INT);
		 
	this creates a table named cats_table within a database named pets_database,
	with empty columns named name and age.
	
8. deleting a table:
	USE <database_name>
	DROP TABLE <table_name>;
	
9. deleting an entire database:
	DROP DATABASE >database_name>;
	
10: commenting in mySQL:
	-- THIS IS A SINGLE-LINE COMMENT (2 dashes and a space, followed by a comment)
	comments are ignored by the database system, are for human reading
